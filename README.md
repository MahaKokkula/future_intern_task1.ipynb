🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis
📌 Overview
This project is focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to explore patterns, handle missing data, perform feature extraction, and gain insights from the dataset – without applying any machine learning models.

🧠 Objective
To explore and understand the Titanic passenger data, identify trends and insights, and apply data cleaning and transformation techniques commonly used in real-world analysis.

🗂 Dataset Information
The dataset used is from the Kaggle Titanic Challenge, containing details of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Key columns include:

PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked, Survived

🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

🔍 Key Steps Performed
🔧 Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Dropped irrelevant columns like Ticket or converted complex columns (e.g., Cabin) into simpler formats.

Converted Sex and Embarked into categorical variables.
